test test test

Created in branch AM_test without commiting => appeared also  in master
so I went back to branch to modify it, again without staging and committing
then went back to master, staged it and committed it there and
it then disapeared from AM_test branch...

Kind of make sense but surprised me :-)


_______________

Now that I have push everything to GitHub, made a pull request, resolve conflicts between 
branch and master (both had modified README) and merdge them, this file (which was only in 
master) appeared in the branch too... so I've had to pull both master and branch again to 
my local repository...

Now I'm gone make a few changes to this file, commit each of them, then try to come back to 
this version without deleting the history...
